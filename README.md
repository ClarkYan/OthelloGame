## Introduction
Othello game or [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game is a two player board game, played on a 8 x 8 chessboard. There are sixty-four identical game pieces, which are black chess on one side and white chess on the other. Players take turns placing pieces on the chessboard with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any pieces of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the piece just placed and another piece of the current player's color are flipped over to the current player's color.

The goal of this game is to achieve the majority of pieces turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. Figure 1 shows the final result of this game.
