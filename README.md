# OthelloGame
## Introduction
Othello game or [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game is a two player board game, played on a 8 x 8 chessboard. There are sixty-four identical game pieces, which are black chess on one side and white chess on the other. Players take turns placing pieces on the chessboard with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any pieces of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the piece just placed and another piece of the current player's color are flipped over to the current player's color.

The goal of this game is to achieve the majority of pieces turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. Figure 1 shows the final result of this game.

## Functionalities Implementation
* NEW GAME: This is a button to make this game to restart.

* RETRACT: This is a button to let players can make a undo function to re-consider a valid move. However, with a consideration of playability about this game, each player can only make once undo function for each step (turn).

* HINTS ON / HINTS OFF: This is a button to give players a hint for each step (turn). HINTS ON is to open this hint function, and HINTS OFF is to close it.

* MUSIC ON / MUSIC OFF: This is a button to show the background music to players for relaxed and attracted. MUSIC ON is to start the music, and MUSIC OFF is to stop the music.

* CHANGE BACKGROUND: This is a button to change the background of this chessboard page. This system stores six background pictures to fit this page, players can change the pictures depending on their feelings.

## Limitations
With the time limitations, this system does not be exactly excellent enough. Under my consideration, the previous object is to implement a Othello Game with Human vs. Human and also Human vs. Computer. However, there are more assignments and exams now, so the Human vs. Computer part does not finish yet.

The user interfaces are not very beautiful, and most images or pictures are downloaded from internet. If this is a real application and will be updated into android application store, to download images from internet is not suitable for a grown-up application. So, it is pretty necessary to use Photoshop to create a new image with my own thinkings.

## Future work
Now you have finished all the required steps. You can do the further analysis as you wish.
If you've encounted any problems, please do not hesitate to send an email to [Clark YAN (me)](https://github.com/ClarkYan) at clarkyan1993@gmail.com or opening an issue on github.
